## 🔑 Environment Setup

Before running, you must create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory.

```bash
# --- Database ---
# Your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
# (For production, ensure Atlas IP Access List is 0.0.0.0/0 for Render)
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://..."

# --- Authentication ---
# A new, strong 64-character random string
# (Use: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_STRONG_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
JWT_LIFETIME="7d"

# --- Server & Security ---
# Port for the server to run on
PORT=8000
# The URL of your deployed React app (for CORS security)
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"
# (For production, update CLIENT_URL to your live Netlify URL)
```
